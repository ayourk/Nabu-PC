# Nabu-PC
PCB Schematics for the Nabu PC

Using KiCAD 6.0.x for this project.  I will accept pull requests against this version only.
Work still needs to be done to route the traces and connect the nets as well as add all of the capacitors, resistors, etc.  The goal of the chip layout in the schematic is to have the chip location to be roughly where it is on the physical board. I've been associating Datasheets and Footprints with all of my Symbols.  For cases of where I need custom symbols, I've been putting them in the local Nabu-PC library.

Please note that the `Docs/Nabu_Computer_Technical_Manual_by_MJP-compressed.pdf` does contain a vague schematic starting on page 18 of the PDF.  The goal of this project is to improve upon that by giving specific IC pin numbers to the the various similar symbols' inputs and outputs.
