PCB Schematics for the Nabu PC

Using KiCAD 6.10 for this project.  I will accept pull requests against this version only.
Currently working on the Schematic and the layout of the chips.  The goal of the chip layout in the schematic is to have the chip location to be roughly where it is on the physical board. I've been associating Datasheets and Footprints with all of my Symbols.  For cases of where I need custom symbols, I've been putting them in the local Nabu-PC library.
